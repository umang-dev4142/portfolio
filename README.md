A responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a front-end web developer. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the site includes smooth animations (AOS) and interactive sliders (Swiper.js). Designed with a clean and modern UI for an engaging user experience across all devices.
